They are, in short, a perfect match.  -- Bill Bryson
Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.  -- Eric Raymond
A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.  -- IEEE Grid newsmagazine
A hacker on a roll may be able to produce--in a period of a few months--something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year.  IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more.  -- Peter Seebach

Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OSes is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders.  -- Alanna

Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to think out every case.  -- Francis Glassborow

You can't have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families.  -- Jim McCarthy
As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.  -- Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are -- by definition -- not smart enough to debug it.  -- Brian Kernighan
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.  -- Edsger W. Dijkstra
I don't care if it works on your machine!  We are not shipping your machine!  -- Vidiu Platon
