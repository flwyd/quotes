A file that big? / It might be very useful / But now it is gone
Yesterday it worked / Today it is not working / Windows is like that
Stay the patient course / Of little worth is your ire / The network is down
Three things are certain: / Death, taxes, and lost data / Guess which has occurred
You step in the stream / But the water has moved on / This page is not here
Out of memory / We wish to hold the whole sky / But we never will
Having been erased / The document you're seeking / Must now be retyped
Rather than a beep / Or a rude error message / These words: "File not found"
Serious error / All shortcuts have disappeared / Screen. Mind. Both are blank.
The web site you seek / Cannot be located but / Endless more exist
Chaos reigns within / Reflect, repent, and reboot / Order shall return
ABORTED EFFORT / Close all that you have / You ask way too much
First snow, then silence / This thousand dollar screen dies / So beautifully
With searching comes loss / And the presence of absence: / "My Novel" not found
The Tao that is seen / Is not the true Tao, until / You bring fresh toner
Windows NT crashed / I am the Blue Screen of Death / No one hears your screams
A crash reduces / Your expensive computer / To a simple stone

They are, in short, a perfect match.  -- Bill Bryson
Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.  -- Eric Raymond
A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.  -- IEEE Grid newsmagazine
A hacker on a roll may be able to produce--in a period of a few months--something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year.  IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more.  -- Peter Seebach

Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OSes is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders.  -- Alanna

You can't have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families.  -- Jim McCarthy
As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.  -- Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are -- by definition -- not smart enough to debug it.  -- Brian Kernighan
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.  -- Edsger W. Dijkstra
I don't care if it works on your machine!  We are not shipping your machine!  -- Vidiu Platon
